## The Mean Value Theorem {#sec:mvt}

We motivate this section with the following question: Suppose you leave
your house and drive to your friend's house in a city 100 miles away,
completing the trip in two hours. At any point during the trip do you
necessarily have to be going 50 miles per hour?

In answering this question, it is clear that the *average* speed for the
entire trip is 50 mph (i.e. 100 miles in 2 hours), but the question is
whether or not your *instantaneous* speed is ever exactly 50 mph. More
simply, does your speedometer ever read exactly 50 mph?. The answer,
under some very reasonable assumptions, is "yes."

Let's now see why this situation is in a calculus text by translating it
into mathematical symbols.\
First assume that the function $y = f(t)$ gives the distance (in miles)
traveled from your home at time $t$ (in hours) where $0\le t\le 2$. In
particular, this gives $f(0)=0$ and $f(2)=100$. The slope of the secant
line connecting the starting and ending points $(0,f(0))$ and $(2,f(2))$
is therefore
$$\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta t} = \frac{f(2)-f(0)}{2-0} = \frac{100-0}{2} = 50 \, \text{mph}.$$

The slope at any point on the graph itself is given by the derivative
$f^{\prime}(t)$. So, since the answer to the question above is "yes,"
this means that at some time during the trip, the derivative takes on
the value of 50 mph. Symbolically,
$$f^{\prime}(c) = \frac{f(2)-f(0)}{2-0} = 50$$ for some time
$0\le c \le 2.$\
How about more generally? Given any function $y=f(x)$ and a range
$a\le x\le b$ does the value of the derivative at some point between $a$
and $b$ have to match the slope of the secant line connecting the points
$(a,f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$? Or equivalently, does the equation
$f^{\prime}(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$ have to hold for some
$a < c < b$?

Let's look at two functions in an example.\

```{example mvt1ex, echo=TRUE}

__(Comparing average and instantaneous rates of change)__

Consider functions $f_1(x)=\frac{1}{x^2}$ with $a=-1$ and $b=1$ as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:mvt1) 
and $f_2(x) = |x|$ with $a=-2$ and $b=2$ in Figure \@ref(fig:mvt1a).
The function $f_1$ has  a value of 1 at $a$ and $b$, and the function $f_2$ has 
the value 2 at $a$ and $b. Therefore the slope of
the secant line connecting the end points is $0$ in each case. But if
you look at the plots of each, you can see that there are no points on
either graph where the tangent lines have slope zero. Therefore we have
found that there is no $c$ in $[-1,1]$ such that
$$f^{\prime}(c) = \frac{f(1)-f(-1)}{1-(-1)} = 0.$$

```

So what went "wrongâ€†"? It may not be surprising to find that the
discontinuity of $f_1$ and the corner of $f_2$ play a role. If our
functions had been continuous and differentiable, would we have been
able to find that special value $c$? This is our motivation for the
following theorem.

```{theorem, label="mvt", echo=TRUE}

(The Mean Value Theorem of Differentiation). Let $y=f(x)$ be a
continuous function on the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable on
the open interval $(a,b)$. There exists a value $c$, $a < c < b$, such
that $$f^{\prime}(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.$$ That is, there is a
value $c$ in $(a,b)$ where the instantaneous rate of change of $f$ at
$c$ is equal to the average rate of change of $f$ on $[a,b]$.

```

Note that the reasons that the functions in Example \@ref(exm:mvt1ex) fail
are indeed that $f_1$ has a discontinuity on the interval $[-1,1]$ and
$f_2$ is not differentiable at the origin.\
We will give a proof of the Mean Value Theorem below. To do so, we use a
fact, called Rolle's Theorem, stated here.

```{theorem, label="rolles", echo=TRUE}

(Rolle's Theorem). Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable
on $(a,b)$, where $f(a) = f(b)$. There is some $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that
$f^{\prime}(c) = 0.$

```

Consider Figure \@ref(fig:mvt3) where the graph of a function $f$ is
given, where $f(a) = f(b)$. It should make intuitive sense that if $f$
is differentiable (and hence, continuous) that there would be a value
$c$ in $(a,b)$ where $f^{\prime}(c)=0$; that is, there would be a
relative maximum or minimum of $f$ in $(a,b)$. Rolle's Theorem
guarantees at least one; there may be more.

        the existence of $c$, where $a<c<b$, where $f^{\prime}(c)=0$.

```

Rolle's Theorem is really just a special case of the Mean Value Theorem.
If $f(a) = f(b)$, then the *average* rate of change on $(a,b)$ is $0$,
and the theorem guarantees some $c$ where $f^{\prime}(c)=0$. We will
prove Rolle's Theorem, then use it to prove the Mean Value Theorem.

**Proof of Rolle's Theorem**

Let $f$ be differentiable on $(a,b)$ where $f(a)=f(b)$. We consider two
cases.

**Case 1:** Consider the case when $f$ is constant on $[a,b]$; that is,
$f(x) = f(a) = f(b)$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$. Then $f^{\prime}(x) = 0$
for all $x$ in $[a,b]$, showing there is at least one value $c$ in
$(a,b)$ where $f^{\prime}(c)=0$.

**Case 2:** Now assume that $f$ is not constant on $[a,b]$. The Extreme
Value Theorem guarantees that $f$ has a maximal and minimal value on
$[a,b]$, found either at the endpoints or at a critical value in
$(a,b)$. Since $f(a)=f(b)$ and $f$ is not constant, it is clear that the
maximum and minimum cannot *both* be found at the endpoints. Assume,
without loss of generality, that the maximum of $f$ is not found at the
endpoints. Therefore there is a $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that $f(c)$ is the
maximum value of $f$. By Theorem \@ref(thm:criticalpts), $c$ must be a
critical number of $f$; since $f$ is differentiable, we have that
$f^{\prime}(c) = 0$, completing the proof of the theorem. $\square$\

We can now prove the Mean Value Theorem.

**Proof of the Mean Value Theorem**

Define the function $$g(x) = f(x) - \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}x.$$ We know
$g$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$ and continuous on $[a,b]$ since $f$ is.
We can show $g(a)=g(b)$ (it is actually easier to show $g(b)-g(a)=0$,
which suffices). We can then apply Rolle's theorem to guarantee the
existence of $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that $g\,'(c) = 0$. But note that
$$0= g\,'(c) = f^{\prime}(c) - \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \ ;$$ hence
$$f^{\prime}(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a},$$ which is what we sought to
prove.$\square$\

-------

Going back to the very beginning of the section, we see that the only
assumption we would need about our distance function $f(t)$ is that it
be continuous and differentiable for $t$ from 0 to 2 hours (both
reasonable assumptions). By the Mean Value Theorem, we are guaranteed a
time during the trip where our instantaneous speed is 50 mph. This fact
is used in practice. Some law enforcement agencies monitor traffic
speeds while in aircraft. They do not measure speed with radar, but
rather by timing individual cars as they pass over lines painted on the
highway whose distances apart are known. The officer is able to measure
the *average* speed of a car between the painted lines; if that average
speed is greater than the posted speed limit, the officer is assured
that the driver exceeded the speed limit at some time.

Note that the Mean Value Theorem is an *existence* theorem. It states
that a special value $c$ *exists*, but it does not give any indication
about how to find it. It turns out that when we need the Mean Value
Theorem, existence is all we need.\

```{example, label="mvt2", echo=TRUE}

(Using the Mean Value Theorem). Consider $f(x) = x^3+5x+5$ on $[-3,3]$.
Find $c$ in $[-3,3]$ that satisfies the Mean Value Theorem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The average rate of change of $f$ on $[-3,3]$ is:
$$\frac{f(3)-f(-3)}{3-(-3)} = \frac{84}{6} = 14.$$

We want to find $c$ such that $f^{\prime}(c) = 14$. We find
$f^{\prime}(x) = 3x^2+5$. We set this equal to 14 and solve for $x$.
$$\begin{aligned}
        f^{\prime}(x) &= 14 \\
        3x^2 +5 &= 14\\
        x^2  &= 3\\
        x &= \pm \sqrt{3} \approx \pm 1.732
        \end{aligned}$$

We have found 2 values $c$ in $[-3,3]$ where the instantaneous rate of
change is equal to the average rate of change; the Mean Value Theorem
guaranteed at least one. In Figure \@ref(fig:mvt4) $f$ is graphed with a
dashed line representing the average rate of change; the lines tangent
to $f$ at $x=\pm \sqrt{3}$ are also given. Note how these lines are
parallel (i.e., have the same slope) with the dashed line.

While the Mean Value Theorem has practical use (for instance, the speed
monitoring application mentioned before), it is mostly used to advance
other theory. We will use it in the next section to relate the shape of
a graph to its derivative. 

Before moving on to the general connection between the shape of a graph and 
the derivative, we look at two simpler results. 

```{theorem, echo=TRUE}
__(If $f'(x)=0$, then $f(x)$ is constant.)__

If $f(x)$ is differentiable on some interval $I$ and $f'(x)=0$ on the interval,
then $f(x)$ is constant on $I$.
```

```

This theorem is the reverse of our previous result that told us how to compute 
the derivative of a constant function: If $f(x)=c$, then $f'(x)=0$. This theorem 
does the reverse, it tells us that the _only_ functions which have zero for their 
derivative are the constant functions. In other words, there are no _other_ 
functions out there which also have this property.

This result can be generalized into the following theorem, which tells us that 
if two functions have the same derivative, they must be very closely related. 
The two functions do not need to be exactly the same, but they do need to be 
vertically shifted versions of one another.

```{theorem, echo=TRUE}
__(Functions with the same derivative differ by a constant.)__
If $f$ and $g$ are differentiable functions on some interval $I$, and $f'(x)=g'(x)$ 
everywhere on $I$, then $g(x)=f(x)+c$ for all $x$ in the interval $I$.
