## Curve Sketching {#sec:sketch}

> **This section is about drawing functions without the help of graphing software
    the drawings in the PDF book for this section are a better representation
    of the use of this technique than the Geograbra plots here.**

We have been learning how we can understand the behavior of a function
based on its first and second derivatives. While we have been treating
the properties of a function separately (increasing and decreasing,
concave up and concave down, etc.), we combine them here to produce an
accurate graph of the function without plotting lots of extraneous
points.

Why bother? Graphing utilities are very accessible, whether on a
computer, a hand--held calculator, or a smartphone. These resources are
usually very fast and accurate. We will see that our method is not
particularly fast -- it will require time (but it is not *hard*). So
again: why bother?

We are attempting to understand the behavior of a function $f$ based on
the information given by its derivatives. While all of a function's
derivatives relay information about it, it turns out that "most" of the
behavior we care about is explained by $f^{\prime}$and $f^{\prime\prime}$. Understanding the
interactions between the graph of $f$ and $f^{\prime}$and $f^{\prime\prime}$is important. To
gain this understanding, one might argue that all that is needed is to
look at lots of graphs. This is true to a point, but is somewhat similar
to stating that one understands how an engine works after looking only
at pictures. It is true that the basic ideas will be conveyed, but
"hands--on" access increases understanding.

The following Theorem summarizes what we have learned so far that is
applicable to sketching graphs of functions and gives a framework for
putting that information together. It is followed by several examples.

```{theorem sketch, echo=TRUE}
To produce an accurate sketch a given function $f$, consider the
following steps.

1.  Find the domain of $f$. Generally, we assume that the domain is the
    entire real line then find restrictions, such as where a denominator
    is 0 or where negatives appear under the radical.
2.  Find the critical values of $f$.
3.  Find the possible points of inflection of $f$.
4.  Find the location of any vertical asymptotes of $f$ (usually done in
    conjunction with item 1 above).
5.  Consider the limits $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to-\infty}f(x)$ and
    $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)$ to determine the end behavior
    of the function.
1.  Create a number line that includes all critical points, possible
    points of inflection, and locations of vertical asymptotes. For each
    interval created, determine whether $f$ is increasing or decreasing,
    concave up or down.
2.  Evaluate $f$ at each critical point and possible point of
    inflection. Plot these points on a set of axes. Connect these points
    with curves exhibiting the proper concavity. Sketch asymptotes and
    $x$ and $y$ intercepts where applicable.

(Curve sketching). Use Theorem \@ref(thm:sketch) to sketch
$f(x) = 3x^3-10x^2+7x+5$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We follow the steps outlined in the Theorem.

1.  The domain of $f$ is the entire real line; there are no values $x$
    for which $f(x)$ is not defined.

2.  Find the critical values of $f$. We compute
    $f^{\prime}(x) = 9x^2-20x+7$. Use the Quadratic Formula to find the
    roots of $f^{\prime}$:
    $$x = \frac{20\pm \sqrt{(-20)^2-4(9)(7)}}{2(9)} = \frac 19\left(10\pm\sqrt{37}\right) \Rightarrow x\approx 0.435, 1.787.$$

3.  Find the possible points of inflection of $f$. Compute
    $f^{\prime\prime}(x) = 18x-20$. We have
    $$f^{\prime\prime}(x) = 0 \Rightarrow x= 10/9 \approx 1.111.$$

4.  There are no vertical asymptotes.

5.  We determine the end behavior using limits as $x$ approaches
    $\pm$infinity.
    $$\lim_{x\to -\infty} f(x) = -\infty \qquad \lim_{x\to \infty}f(x) = \infty.$$
    We do not have any horizontal asymptotes.

6.  We place the values $x=(10\pm\sqrt{37})/9$ and $x=10/9$ on a number
    line, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:sketchline1). We mark each
    subinterval as increasing or decreasing, concave up or down, using
    the techniques used in Sections \@ref(sec:incr-decr) and
    \@ref(sec:concavity).

7.  We plot the appropriate points on axes as shown in Figure
    \@ref(fig:sketch1)(a) and connect the points with straight lines. In
    Figure \@ref(fig:sketch1)(b) we adjust these lines to demonstrate
    the proper concavity. Our curve crosses the $y$ axis at $y=5$ and
    crosses the $x$ axis near $x=-0.424$. In Figure
    \@ref(fig:sketch1)(c) we show a graph of $f$ drawn with a computer
    program, verifying the accuracy of our sketch.

```{example, label="sketch2", echo=TRUE}

(Curve sketching). Sketch
$\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{x^2-x-2}{x^2-x-6}$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We again follow the steps outlined in Theorem \@ref(thm:sketch).

1.  In determining the domain, we assume it is all real numbers and look
    for restrictions. We find that at $x=-2$ and $x=3$, $f(x)$ is not
    defined. So the domain of $f$ is
    $D = \{\text{real numbers } x\ | \ x\neq -2,3\}$.

2.  To find the critical values of $f$, we first find $f^{\prime}(x)$.
    Using the Quotient Rule, we find
    $$f^{\prime}(x) = \frac{-8x+4}{(x^2+x-6)^2} = \frac{-8x+4}{(x-3)^2(x+2)^2}.$$

    $f^{\prime}(x) = 0$ when $x = 1/2$, and $f^{\prime}$ is undefined
    when $x=-2,3$. Since $f^{\prime}$is undefined only when $f$ is, these are
    not critical values. The only critical value is $x=1/2$.

3.  To find the possible points of inflection, we find
    $f^{\prime\prime}(x)$, again employing the Quotient Rule:
    $$f^{\prime\prime}(x) = \frac{24x^2-24x+56}{(x-3)^3(x+2)^3}.$$

    We find that $f^{\prime\prime}(x)$ is never 0 (setting the numerator
    equal to 0 and solving for $x$, we find the only roots to this
    quadratic are imaginary) and $f^{\prime\prime}$is undefined when $x=-2,3$. Thus
    concavity will possibly only change at $x=-2$ and $x=3$.

4.  The vertical asymptotes of $f$ are at $x=-2$ and $x=3$, the places
    where $f$ is undefined.

5.  There is a horizontal asymptote of $y=1$, as
    $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to -\infty}f(x) = 1$ and
    $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x) =1$.

6.  We place the values $x=1/2$, $x=-2$ and $x=3$ on a number line as
    shown in Figure \@ref(fig:sketchline2). We mark in each interval
    whether $f$ is increasing or decreasing, concave up or down. We see
    that $f$ has a relative maximum at $x=1/2$; concavity changes only
    at the vertical asymptotes.

7.  In Figure \@ref(fig:sketch2)(a), we plot the points from the number
    line on a set of axes and connect the points with straight lines to
    get a general idea of what the function looks like (these lines
    effectively only convey increasing/decreasing information). In
    Figure \@ref(fig:sketch2)(b), we adjust the graph with the
    appropriate concavity. We also show $f$ crossing the $x$ axis at
    $x=-1$ and $x=2$.

Figure \@ref(fig:sketch2)(c) shows a computer generated graph of $f$,
which verifies the accuracy of our sketch.

```{example, label="sketch3", echo=TRUE}

(Curve sketching). Sketch
$\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{5(x-2)(x+1)}{x^2+2x+4}.$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We again follow Theorem \@ref(thm:sketch).

1.  We assume that the domain of $f$ is all real numbers and consider
    restrictions. The only restrictions come when the denominator is 0,
    but this never occurs. Therefore the domain of $f$ is all real
    numbers, $\mathbb{R}$.

2.  We find the critical values of $f$ by setting $f^{\prime}(x)=0$ and
    solving for $x$. We find
    $$f^{\prime}(x) = \frac{15x(x+4)}{(x^2+2x+4)^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad f^{\prime}(x) = 0 \text{ when } \ x=-4,0.$$

3.  We find the possible points of inflection by solving
    $f^{\prime\prime}(x) = 0$ for $x$. We find
    $$f^{\prime\prime}(x) = -\frac{30x^3+180x^2-240}{(x^2+2x+4)^3} .$$
    The cubic in the numerator does not factor very "nicely." We instead
    approximate the roots at $x= -5.759$, $x=-1.305$ and $x=1.064$.

4.  There are no vertical asymptotes.

5.  We have a horizontal asymptote of $y=5$, as
    $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to-\infty}f(x) = \lim_{x\to\infty}f(x) = 5$.

6.  We place the critical points and possible points on a number line as
    shown in Figure \@ref(fig:sketchline3) and mark each interval as
    increasing/decreasing, concave up/down appropriately.

7.  In Figure \@ref(fig:sketch3)(a) we plot the significant points from
    the number line as well as the two roots of $f$, $x=-1$ and $x=2$,
    and connect the points with straight lines to get a general
    impression about the graph. In Figure \@ref(fig:sketch3)(b), we add
    concavity. Figure \@ref(fig:sketch3)(c) shows a computer generated
    graph of $f$, affirming our results.

In each of our examples, we found a few, significant points on the graph
of $f$ that corresponded to changes in increasing/decreasing or
concavity. We connected these points with straight lines, then adjusted
for concavity, and finished by showing a very accurate, computer
generated graph.

Why are computer graphics so good? It is not because computers are
"smarter" than we are. Rather, it is largely because computers are much
faster at computing than we are. In general, computers graph functions
much like most students do when first learning to draw graphs: they plot
equally spaced points, then connect the dots using lines. By using lots
of points, the connecting lines are short and the graph looks smooth.

This does a fine job of graphing in most cases (in fact, this is the
method used for many graphs in this text). However, in regions where the
graph is very "curvy," this can generate noticeable sharp edges on the
graph unless a large number of points are used. High quality computer
algebra systems, such as *Mathematica*, use special algorithms to plot
lots of points only where the graph is "curvy."

In Figure \@ref(fig:mathematica-sinx), a graph of $y=\sin x$ is given,
generated by *Mathematica*. The small points represent each of the
places *Mathematica* sampled the function. Notice how at the "bends" of
$\sin x$, lots of points are used; where $\sin x$ is relatively
straight, fewer points are used. (Many points are also used at the
endpoints to ensure the "end behavior" is accurate.) In fact, in the
interval of length $0.2$ centered around $\pi/2$, *Mathematica* plots 72
of the 431 points plotted; that is, it plots about 17% of its points in
a subinterval that accounts for about 3% of the total interval length.

How does *Mathematica* know where the graph is "curvy"? Calculus. When
we study *curvature* in a later chapter, we will see how the first and
second derivatives of a function work together to provide a measurement
of "curviness." *Mathematica* employs algorithms to determine regions of
"high curvature" and plots extra points there.

Again, the goal of this section is not "How to graph a function when
there is no computer to help." Rather, the goal is "Understand that the
shape of the graph of a function is largely determined by understanding
the behavior of the function at a few key places." In Example
\@ref(exm:sketch3), we were able to accurately sketch a complicated
graph using only 5 points and knowledge of asymptotes!

There are many applications of our understanding of derivatives beyond
curve sketching. The next chapter explores some of these applications,
demonstrating just a few kinds of problems that can be solved with a
basic knowledge of differentiation.
