## Taylor Polynomials {#sec:taylor-poly}

Consider a function $y=f(x)$ and a point $\big(c,f(c)\big)$. The
derivative, $f^{\prime}(c)$, gives the instantaneous rate of change of
$f$ at $x=c$. Of all lines that pass through the point
$\big(c,f(c)\big)$, the line that best approximates $f$ at this point is
the tangent line; that is, the line whose slope (rate of change) is
$f^{\prime}(c)$.

In Figure \@ref(fig:taypolyintroa), we see a function $y=f(x)$ graphed.
The table below the graph shows that $f(0)=2$ and $f^{\prime}(0) = 1$;
therefore, the tangent line to $f$ at $x=0$ is
$p_1(x) = 1(x-0)+2 = x+2$. The tangent line is also given in the figure.
Note that "near" $x=0$, $p_1(x) \approx f(x)$; that is, the tangent line
approximates $f$ well.

**Table 1**. caption: Plotting $y=f(x)$ and a table of derivatives of
$f$ evaluated at 0.
:::

One shortcoming of this approximation is that the tangent line only
matches the slope of $f$; it does not, for instance, match the concavity
of $f$. We can find a polynomial, $p_2(x)$, that does match the
concavity without much difficulty, though. The table in Figure
\@ref(fig:taypolyintroa) gives the following information:
$$f(0) = 2 \qquad f^{\prime}(0) = 1\qquad f^{\prime}'(0) = 2.$$
Therefore, we want our polynomial $p_2(x)$ to have these same
properties. That is, we need
$$p_2(0) = 2 \qquad p_2'(0) = 1 \qquad p_2''(0) = 2.$$

This is simply an initial--value problem. We can solve this using the
techniques first described in Section \@ref(sec:antider). To keep
$p_2(x)$ as simple as possible, we'll assume that not only $p_2''(0)=2$,
but that $p_2''(x)=2$. That is, the second derivative of $p_2$ is
constant.

If $p_2''(x) = 2$, then $p_2'(x) = 2x+C$ for some constant $C$. Since we
have determined that $p_2'(0) = 1$, we find that $C=1$ and so
$p_2'(x) = 2x+1$. Finally, we can compute $p_2(x) = x^2+x+C$. Using our
initial values, we know $p_2(0) = 2$ so $C=2.$ We conclude that
$p_2(x) = x^2+x+2.$ This function is plotted with $f$ in Figure
\@ref(fig:taypolyintrob).

```

We can repeat this approximation process by creating polynomials of
higher degree that match more of the derivatives of $f$ at $x=0$. In
general, a polynomial of degree $n$ can be created to match the first
$n$ derivatives of $f$. Figure \@ref(fig:taypolyintrob) also shows
$p-4(x)= -x^4/2-x^3/6+x^2+x+2$, whose first four derivatives at 0 match
those of $f$. (Using the table in Figure \@ref(fig:taypolyintroa), start
with $p-4^{(4)}(x)=-12$ and solve the related initial--value problem.)

As we use more and more derivatives, our polynomial approximation to $f$
gets better and better. In this example, the interval on which the
approximation is "good" gets bigger and bigger. Figure
\@ref(fig:taypolyintroc) shows $p-{13}(x)$; we can visually affirm that
this polynomial approximates $f$ very well on $[-2,3]$. (The polynomial
$p-{13}(x)$ is not particularly "nice". It is
$$\frac{16901x^{13}}{6227020800}+\frac{13x^{12}}{1209600}-\frac{1321x^{11}}{39916800}-\frac{779x^{10}}{1814400}-\frac{359x^9}{362880}+\frac{x^8}{240}+\frac{139x^7}{5040}+\frac{11 x^6}{360}-\frac{19x^5}{120}-\frac{x^4}{2}-\frac{x^3}{6}+x^2+x+2.)$$

The polynomials we have created are examples of *Taylor polynomials*,
named after the British mathematician Brook Taylor who made important
discoveries about such functions. While we created the above Taylor
polynomials by solving initial--value problems, it can be shown that
Taylor polynomials follow a general pattern that make their formation
much more direct. This is described in the following definition.

```{definition, label="taypoly", echo=TRUE}

(Taylor Polynomial, Maclaurin Polynomial). Let $f$ be a function whose
first $n$ derivatives exist at $x=c$.

1.  The **Taylor polynomial of degree $n$ of $f$ at $x=c$** is
    $$p_n(x) = f(c) + f^{\prime}(c)(x-c) + \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(c)}{2!}(x-c)^2+\frac{f^{\prime}''(c)}{3!}(x-c)^3+\cdots+\frac{f\,^{(n)}(c)}{n!}(x-c)^n.$$

2.  A special case of the Taylor polynomial is the Maclaurin polynomial,
    where $c=0$. That is, the **Maclaurin polynomial of degree $n$ of
    $f$** is
    $$p_n(x) = f(0) + f^{\prime}(0)x + \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(0)}{2!}x^2+\frac{f^{\prime}''(0)}{3!}x^3+\cdots+\frac{f\,^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n.$$

```

We will practice creating Taylor and Maclaurin polynomials in the
following examples.\

```{example, label="taypoly1", echo=TRUE}

(Finding and using Maclaurin polynomials).

1.  Find the $n^\text{th}$ Maclaurin polynomial for $f(x) = e^x$.

2.  Use $p_5(x)$ to approximate the value of $e$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  We start with creating a table of the derivatives of $e^x$ evaluated
    at $x=0$. In this particular case, this is relatively simple, as
    shown in Figure \@ref(fig:taypoly1a).

    ::: {#fig:taypoly1a .tab}
    **Table 2**. caption: The derivatives of $f(x)=e^x$ evaluated at
    $x=0$.
    :::

    By the definition of the Maclaurin series, we have

    $$\begin{aligned}
    p_n(x) &= f(0) + f^{\prime}(0)x + \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(0)}{2!}x^2+\frac{f^{\prime}''(0)}{3!}x^3+\cdots+\frac{f\,^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n\\
                &= 1+x+\frac{1}{2}x^2+\frac{1}{6}x^3 + \frac{1}{24}x^4 + \cdots + \frac{1}{n!}x^n.\end{aligned}$$

2.  Using our answer from part 1, we have
    $$p_5 = 1+x+\frac{1}{2}x^2+\frac{1}{6}x^3 + \frac{1}{24}x^4 + \frac{1}{120}x^5.$$
    To approximate the value of $e$, note that
    $e = e^1 = f(1) \approx p_5(1).$ It is very straightforward to
    evaluate $p_5(1)$:
    $$p_5(1) = 1+1+\frac 12+\frac 16+\frac 1{24}+\frac 1{120} = \frac{163}{60} \approx 2.71667.$$

    A plot of $f(x)=e^x$ and $p_5(x)$ is given in Figure
    \@ref(fig:taypoly1b).

(Finding and using Taylor polynomials).

1.  Find the $n^\text{th}$ Taylor polynomial of $y=\ln x$ at $x=1$.

2.  Use $p_6(x)$ to approximate the value of $\ln 1.5$.

3.  Use $p_6(x)$ to approximate the value of $\ln 2$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  We begin by creating a table of derivatives of $\ln x$ evaluated at
    $x=1$. While this is not as straightforward as it was in the
    previous example, a pattern does emerge, as shown in Figure
    \@ref(fig:taypoly2a).

    ::: {#fig:taypoly2a .tab}
    **Table 3**. caption: Derivatives of $\ln x$ evaluated at $x=1$.
    :::

    Using Definition \@ref(def:taypoly), we have $$\begin{aligned}
        p_n(x) &=   f(c) + f^{\prime}(c)(x-c) + \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(c)}{2!}(x-c)^2+\frac{f^{\prime}''(c)}{3!}(x-c)^3+\cdots+\frac{f\,^{(n)}(c)}{n!}(x-c)^n\\
                        &= 0+(x-1)-\frac 12(x-1)^2+\frac 13(x-1)^3-\frac 14(x-1)^4+\cdots+\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}(x-1)^n.\end{aligned}$$
    Note how the coefficients of the $(x-1)$ terms turn out to be
    "nice."

2.  We can compute $p_6(x)$ using our work above:
    $$p_6(x) = (x-1)-\frac 12(x-1)^2+\frac 13(x-1)^3-\frac 14(x-1)^4+\frac 15(x-1)^5-\frac 16(x-1)^6.$$
    Since $p_6(x)$ approximates $\ln x$ well near $x=1$, we approximate
    $\ln 1.5 \approx p_6(1.5)$:

    $$\begin{aligned}
    p_6(1.5) &= (1.5-1)-\frac 12(1.5-1)^2+\frac 13(1.5-1)^3-\frac 14(1.5-1)^4+\cdots \\
                &\cdots +\frac 15(1.5-1)^5-\frac 16(1.5-1)^6\\
        &=\frac{259}{640}\\
        &\approx 0.404688.\end{aligned}$$ This is a good approximation
    as a calculator shows that $\ln 1.5 \approx 0.4055.$ Figure
    \@ref(fig:taypoly2b) plots $y=\ln x$ with $y=p_6(x)$. We can see
    that $\ln 1.5\approx p_6(1.5)$.

    ```{geogebra, label="taypoly2b"}

    caption: A plot of $y=\ln x$ and its 6$^\text{th}$ degree Taylor
    polynomial at $x=1$.

    ```

3.  We approximate $\ln 2$ with $p_6(2)$: $$\begin{aligned}
    p_6(2) &= (2-1)-\frac 12(2-1)^2+\frac 13(2-1)^3-\frac 14(2-1)^4+\cdots \\
                &\cdots +\frac 15(2-1)^5-\frac 16(2-1)^6\\
                &=  1-\frac 12+\frac 13-\frac 14+\frac 15-\frac 16 \\
                &= \frac{37}{60}\\ 
                &\approx 0.616667.\end{aligned}$$ This approximation is
    not terribly impressive: a hand held calculator shows that
    $\ln 2 \approx 0.693147.$ The graph in Figure \@ref(fig:taypoly2b)
    shows that $p_6(x)$ provides less accurate approximations of $\ln x$
    as $x$ gets close to 0 or 2.

    Surprisingly enough, even the 20$^\text{th}$ degree Taylor
    polynomial fails to approximate $\ln x$ for $x>2$, as shown in
    Figure \@ref(fig:taypoly2c). We'll soon discuss why this is.

\
Taylor polynomials are used to approximate functions $f(x)$ in mainly
two situations:

1.  When $f(x)$ is known, but perhaps "hard" to compute directly. For
    instance, we can define $y=\cos x$ as either the ratio of sides of a
    right triangle ("adjacent over hypotenuse") or with the unit circle.
    However, neither of these provides a convenient way of computing
    $\cos 2$. A Taylor polynomial of sufficiently high degree can
    provide a reasonable method of computing such values using only
    operations usually hard--wired into a computer ($+$, $-$, $\times$
    and $\div$).

2.  When $f(x)$ is not known, but information about its derivatives is
    known. This occurs more often than one might think, especially in
    the study of differential equations.

> **Note:** Even though Taylor polynomials *could* be used in
> calculators and computers to calculate values of trigonometric
> functions, in practice they generally aren't. Other more efficient and
> accurate methods have been developed, such as the CORDIC algorithm.

In both situations, a critical piece of information to have is "How good
is my approximation?" If we use a Taylor polynomial to compute $\cos 2$,
how do we know how accurate the approximation is?

We had the same problem when studying Numerical Integration. Theorem
\@ref(thm:numerical-error) provided bounds on the error when using, say,
Simpson's Rule to approximate a definite integral. These bounds allowed
us to determine that, for instance, using $10$ subintervals provided an
approximation within $\pm .01$ of the exact value. The following theorem
gives similar bounds for Taylor (and hence Maclaurin) polynomials.

```{theorem, label="taylorthm", echo=TRUE}

(Taylor's Theorem).

1.  Let $f$ be a function whose $n+1^\text{th}$ derivative exists on an
    interval $I$ and let $c$ be in $I$. Then, for each $x$ in $I$, there
    exists $z_x$ between $x$ and $c$ such that
    $$f(x) = f(c) + f^{\prime}(c)(x-c) + \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(c)}{2!}(x-c)^2+ \cdots +\frac{f\,^{(n)}(c)}{n!}(x-c)^n+R_n(x),$$
    where
    $\displaystyle R_n(x) = \frac{f\,^{(n+1)}(z_x)}{(n+1)!}(x-c)^{(n+1)}.$

2.  $\displaystyle\big|R_n(x)\big| \leq \frac{\max\left|\,f\,^{(n+1)}(z)\right|}{(n+1)!}\big|(x-c)^{(n+1)}\big|$,
    where $z$ is in $I$.

```

The first part of Taylor's Theorem states that $f(x) = p_n(x) + R_n(x)$,
where $p_n(x)$ is the $n^\text{th}$ order Taylor polynomial and $R_n(x)$
is the remainder, or error, in the Taylor approximation. The second part
gives bounds on how big that error can be. If the $(n+1)^\text{th}$
derivative is large on $I$, the error may be large; if $x$ is far from
$c$, the error may also be large. However, the $(n+1)!$ term in the
denominator tends to ensure that the error gets smaller as $n$
increases.

The following example computes error estimates for the approximations of
$\ln 1.5$ and $\ln 2$ made in Example \@ref(exm:taypoly2).\

```{example, label="taypoly3", echo=TRUE}

(Finding error bounds of a Taylor polynomial). Use Theorem
\@ref(thm:taylorthm) to find error bounds when approximating $\ln 1.5$
and $\ln 2$ with $p_6(x)$, the Taylor polynomial of degree 6 of
$f(x)=\ln x$ at $x=1$, as calculated in Example \@ref(exm:taypoly2).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  We start with the approximation of $\ln 1.5$ with $p_6(1.5)$. The
    theorem references an open interval $I$ that contains both $x$ and
    $c$. The smaller the interval we use the better; it will give us a
    more accurate (and smaller!) approximation of the error. We let
    $I = (0.9,1.6)$, as this interval contains both $c=1$ and $x=1.5$.

    The theorem references $\max\big|f\,^{(n+1)}(z)\big|$. In our
    situation, this is asking "How big can the $7^\text{th}$ derivative
    of $y=\ln x$ be on the interval $(0.9,1.6)$?" The seventh derivative
    is $y = -6!/x^7$. The largest value it attains on $I$ is about 1506.
    Thus we can bound the error as: $$\begin{aligned}
    \big|R_6(1.5)\big| &\leq \frac{\max\big|f\,^{(7)}(z)\big|}{7!}\big|(1.5-1)^7\big|\\
                        &\leq \frac{1506}{5040}\cdot\frac 1{2^7}\\
                        &\approx 0.0023.\end{aligned}$$ We computed
    $p_6(1.5) = 0.404688$; using a calculator, we find
    $\ln 1.5 \approx 0.405465$, so the actual error is about $0.000778$,
    which is less than our bound of $0.0023$. This affirms Taylor's
    Theorem; the theorem states that our approximation would be within
    about 2 thousandths of the actual value, whereas the approximation
    was actually closer.

2.  We again find an interval $I$ that contains both $c=1$ and $x=2$; we
    choose $I = (0.9,2.1)$. The maximum value of the seventh derivative
    of $f$ on this interval is again about 1506 (as the largest values
    come near $x=0.9$). Thus $$\begin{aligned}
    \big| R_6(2)\big| &\leq \frac{\max\big|f\,^{(7)}(z)\big|}{7!}\big|(2-1)^7\big|\\
                        &\leq \frac{1506}{5040}\cdot 1^7\\
                        &\approx 0.30.\end{aligned}$$ This bound is not
    as nearly as good as before. Using the degree 6 Taylor polynomial at
    $x =1$ will bring us within 0.3 of the correct answer. As
    $p_6(2)\approx 0.61667$, our error estimate guarantees that the
    actual value of $\ln 2$ is somewhere between $0.31667$ and
    $0.91667$. These bounds are not particularly useful.

    In reality, our approximation was only off by about 0.07. However,
    we are approximating ostensibly because we do not know the real
    answer. In order to be assured that we have a good approximation, we
    would have to resort to using a polynomial of higher degree.

```

We practice again. This time, we use Taylor's theorem to find $n$ that
guarantees our approximation is within a certain amount.\

```{example, label="taypoly4", echo=TRUE}

(Finding sufficiently accurate Taylor polynomials). Find $n$ such that
the $n^\text{th}$ Taylor polynomial of $f(x)=\cos x$ at $x=0$
approximates $\cos 2$ to within $0.001$ of the actual answer. What is
$p_n(2)$?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following Taylor's theorem, we need bounds on the size of the
derivatives of $f(x)=\cos x$. In the case of this trigonometric
function, this is easy. All derivatives of cosine are $\pm \sin x$ or
$\pm \cos x$. In all cases, these functions are never greater than 1 in
absolute value. We want the error to be less than $0.001$. To find the
appropriate $n$, consider the following inequalities: $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\max\big|f\,^{(n+1)}(z)\big|}{(n+1)!}\big|(2-0)^{(n+1)}\big| &\leq 0.001 \\
\frac 1{(n+1)!}\cdot 2^{(n+1)} &\leq 0.001\end{aligned}$$ We find an $n$
that satisfies this last inequality with trial--and--error. When $n=8$,
we have $\displaystyle\frac{2^{8+1}}{(8+1)!} \approx 0.0014$; when
$n=9$, we have
$\displaystyle\frac{2^{9+1}}{(9+1)!} \approx 0.000282 <0.001$. Thus we
want to approximate $\cos 2$ with $p_9(2)$.\
We now set out to compute $p_9(x)$. We again need a table of the
derivatives of $f(x)=\cos x$ evaluated at $x=0$. A table of these values
is given in Figure \@ref(fig:taypoly4a).

::: {#fig:taypoly4a .tab}
**Table 4**. caption: A table of the derivatives of $f(x)=\cos x$
evaluated at $x=0$.
:::

Notice how the derivatives, evaluated at $x=0$, follow a certain
pattern. All the odd powers of $x$ in the Taylor polynomial will
disappear as their coefficient is 0. While our error bounds state that
we need $p_9(x)$, our work shows that this will be the same as $p_8(x)$.

Since we are forming our polynomial at $x=0$, we are creating a
Maclaurin polynomial, and: $$\begin{aligned}
p_8(x) &= f(0) + f^{\prime}(0)x + \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(0)}{2!}x^2 + \frac{f^{\prime}''(0)}{3!}x^3 + \cdots +\frac{f\,^{(8)}(0)}{8!}x^8\\
        &=  1-\frac{1}{2!}x^2+\frac{1}{4!}x^4-\frac{1}{6!}x^6+\frac{1}{8!}x^8\end{aligned}$$

We finally approximate $\cos 2$:
$$\cos 2 \approx p_8(2) = -\frac{131}{315} \approx -0.41587.$$ Our error
bound guarantee that this approximation is within $0.001$ of the correct
answer. Technology shows us that our approximation is actually within
about $0.0003$ of the correct answer.

Figure \@ref(fig:taypoly4b) shows a graph of $y=p_8(x)$ and $y=\cos x$.
Note how well the two functions agree on about $(-\pi,\pi)$.

2.  Use $p_4(x)$ to approximate $\sqrt{3}$.

3.  Find bounds on the error when approximating $\sqrt{3}$ with
    $p_4(3)$.

1.  We begin by evaluating the derivatives of $f$ at $x=4$. This is done
    in Figure \@ref(fig:taypoly5a).

    **Table 5**. caption: A table of the derivatives of $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$

    :::

    These values allow us to form the Taylor polynomial $p_4(x)$:
    $$p_4(x) = 2 + \frac 14(x-4) +\frac{-1/32}{2!}(x-4)^2+\frac{3/256}{3!}(x-4)^3+\frac{-15/2048}{4!}(x-4)^4.$$

2.  As $p_4(x) \approx \sqrt{x}$ near $x=4$, we approximate $\sqrt{3}$
    with $p_4(3) = 1.73212$.

3.  To find a bound on the error, we need an open interval that contains
    $x=3$ and $x=4$. We set $I = (2.9,4.1)$. The largest value the fifth
    derivative of $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ takes on this interval is near
    $x=2.9$, at about $0.0273$. Thus
    $$\big|R_4(3)\big| \leq \frac{0.0273}{5!}\big|(3-4)^5\big| \approx 0.00023.$$
    This shows our approximation is accurate to at least the first 2
    places after the decimal. (It turns out that our approximation is
    actually accurate to 4 places after the decimal.) A graph of
    $f(x)=\sqrt x$ and $p_4(x)$ is given in Figure \@ref(fig:taypoly5b).
    Note how the two functions are nearly indistinguishable on $(2,7)$.

\
Our final example gives a brief introduction to using Taylor polynomials
to solve differential equations.\

```{example, label="taypoly6", echo=TRUE}

(Approximating an unknown function). A function $y=f(x)$ is unknown save
for the following two facts.

1.  $y(0) = f(0) = 1$, and

2.  $y\,'= y^2$

(This second fact says that amazingly, the derivative of the function is
actually the function squared!)

Find the degree 3 Maclaurin polynomial $p_3(x)$ of $y=f(x)$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One might initially think that not enough information is given to find
$p_3(x)$. However, note how the second fact above actually lets us know
what $y\,'(0)$ is: $$y\,' = y^2 \Rightarrow y\,'(0) = y^2(0).$$ Since
$y(0) = 1$, we conclude that $y\,'(0) = 1$.

Now we find information about $y\,''$. Starting with $y\,'=y^2$, take
derivatives of both sides, *with respect to $x$*. That means we must use
implicit differentiation. $$\begin{aligned}
y\,' &= y^2\\
\frac{d}{dx}\big(y\,'\big) &= \frac{d}{dx}\big(y^2\big)\\
y\,'' &= 2y\cdot y\,'.
\intertext{Now evaluate both sides at $x=0$:}
y\,''(0) &= 2y(0)\cdot y\,'(0)\\
y\,''(0) &= 2\end{aligned}$$ We repeat this once more to find
$y\,'''(0)$. We again use implicit differentiation; this time the
Product Rule is also required. $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx}\big(y\,''\big) &= \frac{d}{dx} \big(2yy\,'\big)\\
y\,''' &= 2y\,'\cdot y\,' + 2y\cdot y\,''.
\intertext{Now evaluate both sides at $x=0$:}
y\,'''(0) &= 2y\,'(0)^2 + 2y(0)y\,''(0)\\
y\,'''(0) &=    2+4=6\end{aligned}$$ In summary, we have:
$$y(0) = 1 \qquad y\,'(0) = 1  \qquad y\,''(0) = 2 \qquad y\,'''(0) = 6.$$
We can now form $p_3(x)$: $$\begin{aligned}
p_3(x) &= 1 + x + \frac{2}{2!}x^2 + \frac{6}{3!}x^3\\
                &= 1+x+x^2+x^3.\end{aligned}$$

It turns out that the differential equation we started with, $y\,'=y^2$,
where $y(0)=1$, can be solved without too much difficulty:
$\displaystyle y = \frac{1}{1-x}$. Figure \@ref(fig:taypoly6) shows this
function plotted with $p_3(x)$. Note how similar they are near $x=0$.

It is beyond the scope of this text to pursue error analysis when using
Taylor polynomials to approximate solutions to differential equations.
This topic is often broached in introductory Differential Equations
courses and usually covered in depth in Numerical Analysis courses. Such
an analysis is very important; one needs to know how good their
approximation is. We explored this example simply to demonstrate the
usefulness of Taylor polynomials.\
Most of this chapter has been devoted to the study of infinite series.
This section has taken a step back from this study, focusing instead on
finite summation of terms. In the next section, we explore **Taylor
Series**, where we represent a function with an infinite series.
